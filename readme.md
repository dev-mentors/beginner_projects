## Welcome!

This is the collection of beginner projects for dev-mentors, containing such riviting
gems as blackjack, and tic tac toe. 

## Layout

The code is split up by language, so frequently the same projects can be found in the flavor
that you are looking for. You can quickly learn another language's syntax by checking out
how identical projects are made in another language. 

Two projects may be slightly different, since these are completed during live sessions. 

```
- java
    -blackjack
        Blacjack.java
- python
    -blackjack
        Blackjack.py
```
